# **ezrM**

## What is ***ezrM***?
ezrM is a **basic but usable programming language written in Malayalam** meant to be easy to learn.
ezrM is heavily based on [***ezr***](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrlang/), so don't forget to check it out!

## How can I use ***ezrM***?
Check out the latest version of the ezrM interpreter [***here!***](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrMlang/releases/)
Also, I recommend using ezrShell++ instead of a command-line interface (cmd, powershell, etc) for running/writing ezrM code.
Most CLIs can't display Malayalam properly, so I made ezrShell++ for both ezr and ezrM. Check it out [***here!***](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrshellplusplus)

## Where is the documentation for ***ezrM***?
While I haven't started on the textual documentation, you can check out my YouTube tutorial series [***here!***](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU7W-ZU9OIiFHRQ-1MRq4n0p8DRPTQTnm)
